## Overview

New website for Girls Run The World, an online training platform that sells video-based fitness courses.


## Technical solution

The website uses Django for its backend framework, and the front-end uses a component-based approach allowing pages to be constructed from reusable content blocks. Payments are handled through Stripe, videos are hosted on Vimeo.


## My role

I helped to plan and design the new website, and was the sole developer who built it.
