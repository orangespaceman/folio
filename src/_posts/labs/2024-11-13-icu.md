## Overview

Two experiments with `getUserMedia`, Face detection and `speechSynthesis`.

The 'eye' experiment was the first to be developed. It tracks faces from a webcam, and manipulates an SVG accordingly.

The 'bear' experiment also tracks a face and manipulates an SVG. It also generates speech depending on how close or far away the face is located.

The following external libraries have been used:

- [Face API](https://justadudewhohacks.github.io/face-api.js/docs/) - for face detection
- [Tween.js](https://tweenjs.github.io/tween.js/) - for animating SVGs

The mute, sound and pointer icons are from [https://www.svgrepo.com/](https://www.svgrepo.com/)

The bear picture was generated by Chatty Jeeps.

The eye SVGs were manually created by hand.
