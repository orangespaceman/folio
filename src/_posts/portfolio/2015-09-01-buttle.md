## Overview

A website for Buttle UK, the largest grant awarding charity in the UK that focuses solely on children and young people in need


## Technical solution

The website uses Expression Engine for a CMS, with a modular system of front-end components and Gulp tasks for linting and minifying CSS and JavaScript.

The front-end features subtle 3d rollover transitions on important site links.


## My role

I was responsible for building the original front-end templates for the website.
