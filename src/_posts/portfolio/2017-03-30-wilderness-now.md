## Overview

The front-end for a website that allows people to book adventure holidays in the UK.

## Technical solution

The website uses Django for its backend, and a component-based system for the front-end.

As part of this work, [Matt](http://mcollins.co.uk/work/wilderness-now/) and I developed a [framework for building component libraries within a Django project](/labs/django-component-library/).

## My role

I was responsible for building the front-end of the website.
