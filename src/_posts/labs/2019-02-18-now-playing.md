## Overview

We listen to music through a Google Home / Chromecast. Which is great, except you have no idea what's currently playing.

I made a thing to live on a Raspberry Pi, that can then be displayed on an iPad (or similar).

It shows details of the current Spotify/BBC 6music track that's playing on the same local network.

Full setup instructions are on GitHub.
