# One-click Resize Chrome Extension

A Chrome extension that resizes your browser to a default size with a single click

The first time you click the icon, you will be redirected to the options page so you can set your preferred resize values.

From then on, the browser will be resized (and moved) to this position every time you click the icon.

You can change the desired values via the options page linked to from the Chrome extensions page.
