## Overview

A custom HTML form that stores data in a Google Form, and uses this information to generate a heatmap using [Leaflet](https://leafletjs.com/) and [Leaflet.heat](https://github.com/Leaflet/Leaflet.heat).

The map checks regularly for updates, and if any new form submissions have been recorded their data is added to the heatmap.

A single device could be used to collect information, or the form could be shared with attendees.

The map could be displayed on a large screen.

This could be used for conferences and gatherings to collect location data from participants.

Full setup instructions are on GitHub.
