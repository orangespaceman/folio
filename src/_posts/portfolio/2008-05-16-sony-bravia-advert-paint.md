# Sony Bravia Advert - Paint

Created a 'blog-fodder' site for the latest Sony BRAVIA advert, to follow on from the successful site we built for the bouncing balls advert we created the year before. This site featured a customised wordpress blog, allowing members of the public to keep up to date with the release of the new advert. It offered high-quality streaming or downloads of the advert itself and related material, including an image gallery and behind the scenes showcase. The site was very successful, receiving plenty of press coverage and over a million hits in the first week after launch
