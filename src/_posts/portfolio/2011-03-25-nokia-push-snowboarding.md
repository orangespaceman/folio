## Overview

Website for Nokia Push Snowboarding, aimed at promoting the use of live data captured by professional snowboarders using sensors, an arduino and a nokia phone.

## Technical solution

Each page is comprised of several reusable content blocks that are laid out dynamically with JavaScript in a modular grid pattern.

## My role

I was responsible for the front-end code for this site.
