## Overview

A React Native app for patients to help manage their eye health.

App users are able to track their treatment, and create goals to help them to manage their condition.


## Technical solution

The React Native app uses Redux Saga to interact with a third-party backend API, while the front-end uses a design system that allows screens to be constructed from reusable components.


## My role

I created the reusable UI components for the design system.
