## Overview

A website to promote the art of the all new magic tortoise


## Technical solution

New images are uploaded to the website in batches.

Twice a week, a new image is automatically published to the site.

At the same time this image is also published to social media accounts - Twitter and Instagram.

The website is built with Django.


## My role

I was the sole developer for the website.
