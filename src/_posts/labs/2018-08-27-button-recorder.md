## Overview

A custom python script on a Google Voice Kit (Raspberry Pi) that can play and record silly sounds.

Plugging the [Button Basher](/labs/makey-makey-button-basher) into the Voice Kit means you can detect when someone presses a button, and play a sound accordingly.

The Voice Kit also comes with its own button, and a microphone. Pressing this button allows you to record a new sound, and then assign it to button on the board.

Full setup notes are on [Github](https://github.com/orangespaceman/button-recorder)
