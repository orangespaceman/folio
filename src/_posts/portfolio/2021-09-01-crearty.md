## Overview

A web app for creating and ordering environmentally-friendly greetings cards.

The app allows users to upload images and manipulate text in order to create their own custom greetings cards.

These cards can then be ordered through the platform.


## Technical solution

The front-end of the web app is built with React.

The backend of the application uses Django and Django Rest Framework, providing an API for the front-end to interact with.


## My role

I helped to create the backend of the application.
