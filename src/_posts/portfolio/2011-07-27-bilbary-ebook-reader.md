## Overview

A prototype responsive ebook-reading web app for Bilbary.

## Technical solution

The app takes an ebook and converts it into a format that can be displayed in a browser of any dimensions.

The app stores a user's reading position so that they can return to a book at any point.

If the browser is resized, the book reflows automatically to present content in paged format.

A progress bar displays the reader's progress through a book.

## My role

I helped create the prototype ebook reader.
