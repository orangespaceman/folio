# Awe-inspring Synonyms - Chrome extension

A Chrome extension that automatically replaces the word 'awesome' with a random (but superior) synonym

## Installation

Open Chrome, open the extensions view (chrome://extensions/) and drag/drop the awe-inspiring-synonyms-extension.crx file into the window

## Usage

The plugin will automatically detect and replace every instance of 'phenomenal' on the page.

These will be underlined to subtly highlight the location of the original word.

To find the replaced words more easily, click the button in the toolbar to toggle a yellow background colour on each replacement.
