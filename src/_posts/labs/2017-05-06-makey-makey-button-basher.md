## Overview

I set up a Makey Makey with custom keyboard mappings to control Spotify and play silly sounds on our studio Mac Mini. I didn't use the default key bindings because then we wouldn't be able to change the music on the machine itself. Instead, the controls are mapped to key-combinations we won't otherwise use.

In addition, the big red button in the middle glows faintly. Just because.

Full setup notes are on [Github](https://github.com/thegingerbloke/button-basher)
