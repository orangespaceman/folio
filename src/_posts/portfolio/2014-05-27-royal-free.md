# Royal Free

## Project overview

Website for London-based hospital the Royal Free.

## Technical solution

The website runs on Expression Engine.

## My role

I assisted with the creation of responsive HTML/CSS layouts, including the home page. I also wrote JavaScript for many of the interactive elements of the site.
