## Overview

Website for a social network start-up promoting ethical ideas and initiatives from around the world.

## Technical solution

The website is a single-page JavaScript web app.

It has a number of social networking features: infinite scrolling of posts, searching and filtering of content, user accounts with followers, geolocation of posts.

The in-house development team provided a REST API using Pyramid.

## My role

I was a member of the development team building the front-end of the app.
