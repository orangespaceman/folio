## Overview

An online advice platform for the organisation Rights of Women, to record their attendance note data from the phone calls received by their advice lines.

You can read more about the website on the [Electric Putty](https://electricputty.co.uk/case-study/transforming-legal-advice-services) website.


## Technical solution

The front-end of the web app is built with Vue. The backend of the application uses Laravel.

We used websockets for auto-saving and validation on every input.

We also created a complex reporting tool to analyse data from across the system.


## My role

I helped to create the backend of the application, and contributed to the front-end too.
