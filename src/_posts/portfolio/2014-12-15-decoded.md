# Decoded

## Project overview

A new booking system for professional training company Decoded.

Alongside this we provided technical consultancy, implementing an Agile working process.

## Technical solution

A Backbone single page web app that interacted with an API built with Django that provided a new booking system for the range of courses offered by Decoded.

## My role

I was a member of the development team responsible for creating the front-end of the web app.
