## Overview

Brighton Astro is a place for cosmic enthusiasts from all walks of life to meet up, talk about the universe and gaze at the stars. Every month we host a FREE talk with drinks and nibbles and the opportunity to go out with our telescopes afterwards â€“ weather permitting!

Once a month (usually the final Tuesday) we gather at 68 Middle Street, Brighton for a presentation on an aspect of the universe. Our speakers range from experts in the field to members of the group; you don't need to know a lot when you come, but you'll definitely leave knowing more!

After the meetings you'll find us on the seafront with our telescopes, or sheltering from the elements in the pub. Brighton Astro is a great place to meet new people, have some fun and learn together.

We're open to everyone, from beginners to experts. So why not join us and look to the stars?
