## Overview

A website aimed at providing UK citizens with information regarding their switchover dates for digital television services

## Technical solution

The build required sections of content to be collapsable, and custom overlays containing extra information to be triggered when the user interacted with specific regions of the page.

## My role

I was responsible for creating HTML templates that would be integrated into a server-side web app.
