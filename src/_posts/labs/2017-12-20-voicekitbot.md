## Overview

A custom python script on a Google Voice Kit (Raspberry Pi) that does...things.

There are two initial pieces of functionality, but it would be simple to extend in future.

First, it listens to commands that will control Spotify (via [Awkbot](/labs/awkbot-slack/)).

Second, if you ask it who should make the tea it checks who is in the studio and picks someone at random.

Full setup notes are on [Github](https://github.com/making-things-club/voicekitbot)
