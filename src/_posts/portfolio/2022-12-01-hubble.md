## Overview

A website for reviewing and booking on-demand workspaces for individuals and companies.


## Technical solution

The front-end of the web app is built with React using Next.js.

The backend of the application uses Django and Django Rest Framework, providing an API for the front-end to interact with.


## My role

I was a member of the team from Measured who worked on several features for both the backend and the front-end of the application.
