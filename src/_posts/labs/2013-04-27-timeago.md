## Overview

This little JavaScript library turns absolute dates (e.g. `2013-04-27 22:58:43`) into a relative time (e.g. 3 minutes ago)

There are various libraries that offer this functionality. Where this one differs is that it uses a single 'global' setTimeout call that happens once per second, rather than a separate setInterval for every element.

This is especially useful when there are a large number of relative dates in a page - reducing the number of timeouts is always a good idea.

## Usage

Create an HTML element with a `datetime` data attribute:

{% highlight html linenos %}
<p class="js-relative" data-datetime="2013-04-27 22:58:43">2013-04-27 22:58:43</p>
{% endhighlight %}

To start timeago, call:

{% highlight javascript linenos %}
timeAgo.init();
{% endhighlight %}

To add a relative date, call:

{% highlight javascript linenos %}
var $el = $(".js-relative");
timeAgo.add($el);
{% endhighlight %}

(where `$el` is a jQuery object containing the element)
