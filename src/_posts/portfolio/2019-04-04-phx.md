## Overview

New website for running club Brighton Phoenix, who train and compete in running and multisport at local, regional, national and international levels.


## Technical solution

The website uses Django for its backend framework, and the front-end uses a component-based approach allowing pages to be constructed from reusable content blocks. Latest news and results are automatically posted on social media.


## My role

I helped to plan and design the new website, and was the sole developer who built it.
