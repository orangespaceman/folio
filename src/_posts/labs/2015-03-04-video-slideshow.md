# Video slideshow

A proof-of-concept full-screen HTML slideshow (using fading transitions) with mixed video and image content

You can use the up/down/left/right arrow keys to control the slideshow, or the back/forward buttons in the browser

It has various issues - for example it doesn't assist with image/video preloading and relies on browser support for different video formats. But for the purposes that I needed to create it, it demonstrated this could be a viable option.
