## Overview

The front-end for a leading e-commerce website selling surf, ski and snowboard gear


## Technical solution

The website uses a Spree backend to manage all products and purchases.

A standalone Node Express app communicates with the Spree API, allowing the front-end of the site to be developed independently.

The front-end uses Mustache templating, SuitCSS and Flight JS to separate everything into isolated components that could be developed and tested in isolation.

A theme-based system was developed to allow multiple sites to run from the same app, with a set of site-specific styles applied on top for each theme.


## My role

I was a member of the development team responsible for creating the front-end of the web app.
