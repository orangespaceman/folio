## Overview

A framework for creating a living component library with Django.

This repository is a demonstration of how to set up a component library using Django.

A component-based architecture means any part of the website can be worked on in isolation, safe in the knowledge that it can be developed, tested and used without impacting on any other part of the website.

Django constructs an application from these components.

Matt has a [write-up of the Django code](http://mcollins.co.uk/notes/drf-component-serializers/).

Full setup notes are on [Github](https://github.com/madebycomrades/django-component-library/)
