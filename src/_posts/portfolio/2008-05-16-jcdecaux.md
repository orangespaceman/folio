# JCDecaux

## Project overview

Website for JCDecaux, provider of 'outdoor advertising solutions'.

## Technical solution

The website used best-practice web standards and progressive enhancement techniques, including the unobtrusive use of Flash & AJAX to create a dynamic menu, and the implementation of an expandable layout to ensure compliance with the W3C WAI accessibility guidelines.

## My role

I was a member of the development team responsible for building the website.
