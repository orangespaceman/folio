# Rockabox

## Project overview

Working with the in-house development team to help develop their advertising platform.

## Technical solution

An AngularJS single page app, complete with unit and functional tests.

The app interacted with a REST API built with Django.

## My role

I was a member of the development team building the front-end of the app.
