## Overview

Website for a firm of financial recruitment consultants based in Farringdon. Their target was to place applicants in high positions within firms, rather than going for a high quantity turnover.

The site proved successful, receiving numerous job applications each week.

## Technical solution

The website allowed applicants to apply for jobs online, submitting CVs in the process.

Members of the team were able to manage jobs and view any submitted job applications.

RSS feeds were offered for users to stay up-to-date with job listings.

## My role

I was responsible for building both the front-end of the site and the custom CMS.
