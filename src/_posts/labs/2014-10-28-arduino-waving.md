# Arduino Waving

An attempt to build something with an Arduino, along with a few friends.

We decided to make an arm on a servo that waved as people walked past a hatch window.

Using a light-sensitive resistor (and a small mirror reflecting light from a nearby wall light), we detected a drop in light levels to activate the servo.
