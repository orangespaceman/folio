# Cupboard Under the Stairs

The Cupboard Under the Stairs are a design collective who make things, a "multi-disciplinary art and design practice devoted to telling stories in 2D and 3D". They create sculptures, collages, installations, illustrations, and much more. This site contains a blog, and a home page that allows members of the Cupboard to add information about their latest projects.
