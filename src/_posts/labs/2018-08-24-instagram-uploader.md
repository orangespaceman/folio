## Overview

An easy way to download 10+ years worth of Flickr photos and videos, and upload them to Instagram, then keep the two in sync. Any new photos uploaded to Flickr will be automatically uploaded to Instagram too.

Flickr is superior for storing, categorising and searching photos. People actually use Instagram. Best of both worlds.

This lab takes advantage of two libraries:

* [https://github.com/Jeroen-G/Flickr](https://github.com/Jeroen-G/Flickr): For accessing the Flickr API
* [https://github.com/mgp25/Instagram-API](https://github.com/mgp25/Instagram-API): For uploading photos to Instagram via an API

This could be set up on a cloud host or Raspberry Pi.

Full set-up instructions are on [Github](https://github.com/orangespaceman/instagram-uploader)
