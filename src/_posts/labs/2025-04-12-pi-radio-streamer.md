## Overview

Stream radio stations to a Chromecast via a Raspberry Pi

A spiritual successor to the old [Now playing](../now-playing/) app, which was a read-only way to see what music is currently playing on a Chromecast Audio.

This is something similar that can run on a Raspberry Pi, and can then be displayed on an iPad (or similar).

It shows details of the current track thatâ€™s playing.

This app can also be used to start radio stations, such as BBC Radio 6 Music or FIP.

Full setup instructions are on GitHub.
