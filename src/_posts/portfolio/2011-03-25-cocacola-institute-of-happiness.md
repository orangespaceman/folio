## Overview

Website for Coca-Cola Institute of Happiness in Spain.

## Technical solution

The site features a number of custom JavaScript widgets, and a section called Feli *("happiness")* which displays and filters relevant research data from the institute based on user selection. The JavaScript for this section was particularly complex.

## My role

I was responsible for the front-end of this site.
