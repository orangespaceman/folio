## Overview

Two experiments with parallax animation of CSS layers, based on tracking - one with `getUserMedia` and face detection, the other using a mobile device's accelerometer.

The two experiments are based on the same concept, scrolling layers of content depending on where the detected face is located, or how the device is oriented.
