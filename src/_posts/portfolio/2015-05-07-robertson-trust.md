## Overview

A website for the Robertson trust, a Scottish organisation responsible for providing funding to people and communities in Scotland


## Technical solution

The website uses Expression Engine for a CMS, with a modular system of front-end components and Gulp tasks for linting and minifying CSS and JavaScript.


## My role

I was responsible for building the front-end of the website.

In addition, I also wrote backend code to extract and manipulate complex datasets from a Salesforce backend.
