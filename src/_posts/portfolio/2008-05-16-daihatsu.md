# Daihatsu

I was the lead developer on the build of the Daihatsu UK website The site promotes each of the car ranges in a clean and clear manner, allowing users to see large images of each vehicle through a custom-built javascript slideshow. The entire site is SEO-friendly, while accessibility remained at the forefront of the build. sIFR has been used to dynamically insert a flash font for the headings for better typography and kerning. If users don't have flash or javascript, they will appear as similar but web-standard fonts.
