## Overview

The 2011 Vodafone Mclaren Mercedes formula one website.

## Technical solution

The site features complex content block logic that randomises layout of content based on its publication date and position on the page.

During a race, the dashboard JavaScript listens to a bespoke feed hosted on a remote nginx server, allowing commentary and telemetry to be updated in real time.

## My role

I was responsible for the front-end code of the site.
