## Overview

An experimental website for the Jerwood Visual Arts group.

The site was an attempt to document the process of exhibiting art at Jerwood Space in London Bridge.

The site was rough round the edges, but intentionally so.

It pulled in related info from a number of sources, but if anything went wrong that's how it stayed.

The site was successful, and was featured in the 2010 D&AD book and Creative Review annual.

For further information see [this article](http://www.creativereview.co.uk/cr-blog/2009/august1/the-ever-evolving-catalogue) from Creative Review.


## Technical solution

The website pulled in information from a number of sources - twitter feeds, blog posts, etc. Each post was assigned a random width and horizontal offset on the page, creating a random non-repeating layout.

## My role

I was responsible for building the front-end of the site.
