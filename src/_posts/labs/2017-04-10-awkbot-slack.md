## Overview

A Slack bot written in Python that does...things.

This has been created for use in our studio.

There are two initial pieces of functionality, but it would be simple to extend in future.

First, it listens to commands to control Spotify on the machine that it's installed on, assuming this is a mac.

Second, it listens for the use of specific emoji, and can play a sound effect for certain ones.

Full setup notes are on [Github](https://github.com/thegingerbloke/awkbot-slack)
