## Overview

An attempt to build a multiplayer game using Meteor and websockets, a variation on the old whack-a-mole games.

You load up _guac-a-mole_ on multiple mobile phones, each player using their phone as a screen in the game.

Each player takes turns having a go, and at the end the winner is the one who manages to chop the most ingredients before the timer runs out.
