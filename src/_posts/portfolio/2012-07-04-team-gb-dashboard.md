## Overview

A web and mobile app displaying live updates for Team GB athletes throughout the Olympics.

## Technical solution

The app was built with Backbone to allow easy separation of view logic and complex data parsing.

It allowed users to search through olympic events and athletes to find relevant information.

A user's favourite events and athletes could be remembered by the app for ease of access in future.

In addition to the main app, a Node.js application was built to retrieve and consolidate data on athletes and events provided by a third-party vendor.

## My role

I was a member of the development team responsible for creating the app.
