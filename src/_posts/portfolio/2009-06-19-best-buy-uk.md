# Best Buy UK

## Project overview

HTML templates for the Best Buy UK website to support their launch in Britain.

## Technical solution

We created HTML page templates that were implemented by an external company who were building the e-commerce aspect of the site.

During this long-term project we produced front-end developer standards documentation to ensure all developers produced consistent code, and to explain our logic to the people integrating our templates into the back-end system.

## My role

I was a member of the front-end development team responsible for creating these templates.
