## Overview

Website for McLaren Applied Technologies.

## Technical solution

The website was contained within a single-page, with sections of content opening and closing based on user interactions.

The site also had a custom CMS built to allow members of the team to change site content easily.

## My role

I was responsible for the back-end system based on Zend Framework used to maintain content for this site.

I also oversaw the creation of the front-end, including the optimisation of the site for iPad users via the use of CSS3 transitions for smoother animations.
