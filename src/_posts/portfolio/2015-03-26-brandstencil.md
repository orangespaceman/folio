## Overview

Brandstencil is a web app that allows charities to manage how their staff communicate their brand, by creating customised versions of print material.


## Technical solution

The app uses the Laravel PHP framework, with PDFs and images generated using wkhtmltopdf.

## My role

I was a member of the development team responsible for building and maintaining the app.
