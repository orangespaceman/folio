# Jerwood Arts Laboratory

An experimental website for the Jerwood Visual Arts group. The site is an attempt to document the process of exhibiting art at Jerwood Space in London Bridge. The site is a bit rough round the edges, but intentionally so. It pulls in related info from a number of sources, but if anything goes wrong that's how it's got to stay.
