## Overview

A website for Samsung, to allow them to collate tweets from users with ideas for TV apps.

## Technical solution

Created a back-end API based on the Zend Framework used by a Flash application to display content.

The system automatically polls twitter, facebook and other websites to search for relevant content.

This information is categorised and passed through a profanity filter before appearing on the site.

A custom administration area was created, allowing moderators to check and alter content, and for the tweaking of search terms.

## My role

I was responsible for building the custom backend CMS and API for the Flash application to interact with.
