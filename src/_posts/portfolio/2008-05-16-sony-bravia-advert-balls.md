## Overview

Website providing information about Sony's "bouncing balls" advert for their BRAVIA television range.

The advert was incredibly popular, winning numerous awards. The website also won an *M&M* award for supporting the campaign.

> There can be few campaigns in the past 12 months that have galvanised public and professional opinion quite as extensively as Fallon's work for Sony Bravia. If you enter the word "advert" into Google, Sony's bravia-advert.com site pops up as the second result. It's not a paid link, merely a measure of the brand advertising's popularity.

Further information about the campaign can be found on the [D&AD website](http://www.dandad.org/en/sony-balls/)

## Technical solution

The website was built with a number of static pages containing information about the advert, along with downloads of the advert itself for people to embed on their own websites.

## My role

I was responsible for building the website.
