I have been working in web development since 2005. I also teach a range of development skills, from beginners learning to code through to complex technical subjects. I have been involved in every stage of large-scale projects, from the initial scoping to delivery and client handover. 

When I'm not in front of a computer, you'll most likely find me playing football, at a gig, stargazing, reading, taking photos, travelling, running, playing the piano, paintballing or snowboarding&hellip;
