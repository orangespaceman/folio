# Samsung Future of TV

Created a back-end API based on the Zend Framework used by a flash application to display and interact with ideas for TV apps. The system automatically polls twitter, facebook and other websites to search for relevant content. This information is categorised and passed through a profanity filter before appearing on the site. A custom administration area was created, allowing moderators to check and alter content, and for the tweaking of search terms.

PHP, Custom CMS based on Zend Framework
