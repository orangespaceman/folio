# Vodafone McLaren Mercedes F1

Responsible for the front-end code of the 2011 Vodafone Mclaren Mercedes formula one website. The site features complex content block logic that randomises layout of content based on its publication date and position on the page. During a race, the dashboard JavaScript listens to a bespoke feed hosted on a remote nginx server, allowing commentary and telemetry to be updated in real time.

HTML, CSS, JavaScript, PHP, Custom CMS based on Zend Framework
