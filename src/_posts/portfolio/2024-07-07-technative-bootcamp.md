## Overview

I was the lead tutor training up a group of 9 interns on a free 16-week intensive bootcamp.

During the bootcamp, the interns were introduced to a range of technical skills, from the fundamentals of HTML and CSS through to complex subjects including database design, version control and testing.

Alongside these technical skills, the interns also worked on their key soft skills to ensure they were work-ready at the end of the bootcamp.

There were several extra weekly sessions introducing industry-standard best practices, along with guest speakers who shared their valuable insight.

During the bootcamp the interns worked on three group projects to provide an insight into life as a developer.

The bootcamp was a success, and there are plans to run more in future.
