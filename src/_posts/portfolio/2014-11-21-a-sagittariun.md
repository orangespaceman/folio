# A-Sagittariun

## Project overview

Website for a musician to promote the release of his new album.

The home page of the website contains clips of every track from the album, with the option to view the site in full screen and keyboard navigation for easy transition between tracks.

## Technical solution

A new Wordpress theme was created for the site, with custom content types used to populate content each section.

Track previews are embedded via bandcamp.

Big Cartel was used for the shop section of the site.

## My role

I was responsible for building the website.
