## Overview

A web app built with the _Centre for Creativity enabled by AI (CebAI)_ from City, University of London.

The app uses AI to create suggestions to help inspire sports coaches to solve their challenges.

The app helps users to identify their challenges and identify possible resolutions.


## Technical solution

The front-end of the web app is built with Vue, with Vuex for state management.

It also uses Tailwind, TypeScript, and auth0 for authentication.

Builds are automatically deployed to Netlify.


## My role

I helped to create the front-end of the application.
