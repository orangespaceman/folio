# Sony Bravia Advert - Paint

## Project overview

A *blog-fodder* site for the 'paint' Sony BRAVIA advert, to follow on from the successful 'bouncing balls' site we created the year before.

The site was very successful, receiving plenty of press coverage and over a million hits in the first week after launch.

For more information see [this article](http://www.marketingmagazine.co.uk/article/626223/sony-bravia-campaigns-no) on the Marketing Magazine website.


## Technical solution

This site was based around a wordpress blog, allowing members of the public to keep up to date with the release of the new advert. It offered high-quality streaming or downloads of the advert itself and related material, including an image gallery and behind the scenes showcase.

## My role

I was responsible for building the website.
