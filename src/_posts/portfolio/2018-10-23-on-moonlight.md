## Overview

A microsite for [On](https://www.on-running.com) to help promote a new running shoe.

The website displays content from the bottom of the page, in a desktop browser you can scroll up to see a parallax scrolling background and at the top of the page the new shoe is revealed.

On a mobile device, it takes advantage of the accelerometer and gyroscope data made available by the JavaScript `deviceorientation` event to calculate scroll position based on the angle that the device is currently held at.
