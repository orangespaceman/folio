I am a developer with over 10 years of professional experience. I also teach a range of development skills, from beginners learning to code through to complex technical subjects.

I have an attention to detail and an eye forperfection. I have been involved in every stage of large-scale projects, from the initial scoping to delivery and client handover. I have a broad range of practical skills and knowledge.

When I'm not in front of a computer, you'll most likely find me playing football, at a gig, stargazing, reading, taking photos, travelling, running, playing the piano, paintballing or snowboardingâ€¦
