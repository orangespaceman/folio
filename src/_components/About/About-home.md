Hello!

I am a freelance developer based in Brighton.

I like to make things, and help people learn how to make things.

On this site you will find a selection of projects I have worked on in my portfolio, and some of my experiments in the labs section.

If you have any comments / compliments / complaints about anything you see on this site please let me know.
