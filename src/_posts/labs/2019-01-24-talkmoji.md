## Overview

Are you about to give a talk?

Are your slides made with HTML/CSS/JS?

Do you want live feedback?

Try Talkmoji!


## Usage

* Think of a unique name for your talk:

  ```data-talk="unique-talk-name"```

* Pick a selection of emoji (or leave this attribute out to use the default set, like on the [example page](https://orangespaceman.github.io/talkmoji/))

  ```data-emoji="ðŸ˜€ðŸ–•ðŸ˜´ðŸ˜„"```

* Add this to your slides:

{% highlight html linenos %}
<link rel="stylesheet" href="https://talkmoji.dev.f90.co.uk/css">
<script src="https://talkmoji.dev.f90.co.uk/js" data-talk="unique-talk-name" data-emoji="ðŸ˜€ðŸ–•ðŸ˜´ðŸ˜„"></script>
{% endhighlight %}

* (Hint: You can leave out the stylesheet and create your own instead to customise its appearance)
* Share the feedback URL with your audience: [https://talkmoji.dev.f90.co.uk/unique-talk-name](https://talkmoji.dev.f90.co.uk/unique-talk-name)
