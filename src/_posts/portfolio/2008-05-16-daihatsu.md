## Overview

Website for Daihatsu UK, showcasing their range of cars.

## Technical solution

The site promoted each of the car ranges in a clean and clear manner, allowing users to see large images of each vehicle through a custom-built JavaScript slideshow.

The entire site was SEO-friendly, while accessibility remained at the forefront of the build.

sIFR was used to dynamically insert a flash font for the headings for better typography and kerning. For users without Flash or JavaScript, they appeared as similar but web-standard font.

## My role

I was the lead developer on the build.
