# Kingston University

I was the sole developer on the build of the new Kingston University site. It aimed to raise the profile of the university in time for the next academic year. Along with clean valid html and structured CSS, it features a few javascript 'effects' (the slideshows on section home pages, and the scrolling tabs) that have been implemented using a methodology called progressive enhancement, so any users visiting the site through older browsers that don't offer support these features don't lose out, they see replacement content. In addition to the creation of html templates, I provided support during the development phase helping their in-house team with suggestions for how to build the site and manage it internally, and providing comprehensive handover documentation.
