## Overview

[James](http://jamescooke.info/) has left [Studio Awkward](https://getawkward.co.uk). For his leaving present, [Ruth](https://www.instagram.com/shitportraits.ruth/) made a doll, and I put a Raspberry Pi-powered soundboard inside that plays stupid sound clips when squeezed.

For added pointlessness, it also connects to a server via websockets and so can be controlled remotely.

Full setup notes are on [Github](https://github.com/thegingerbloke/jambot)
