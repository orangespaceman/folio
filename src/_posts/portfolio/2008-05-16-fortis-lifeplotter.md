# Fortis Lifeplotter

## Project overview

A flash application that saved any number of datapoints relating to a line graph charting a user's life events.

Upon successful completion of a graph, an email was generated and sent to the user allowing them to retrieve and edit their graph at a later date.

## Technical solution

Custom backend for the Flash application, using AMFPHP for communication.

## My role

I was responsible for building the custom CMS.
