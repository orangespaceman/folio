## Overview

We are a tribe of creative micro-businesses working together in our Brighton studio.

We collaborate on projects, bringing together our specialist talents in the service of others. There's not much we can't do as a team, but if you want a quick list, we specialise in copywriting, coding, animation, branding, tone-of-voice, film-making, photography, workshops and all kinds of design - we're also pretty good at making websites.
