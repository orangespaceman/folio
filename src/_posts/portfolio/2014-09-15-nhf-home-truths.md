# National Housing Federation - Home Truths

## Project overview

An interactive quiz for the National Housing Federation to support the publication of a new report.

Users enter their postcode, and then attempt to answer 10 questions about housing in their local area. They are given a score based on how accurately they can answer the questions.

## Technical solution

The app was built with AngularJS, which enabled easy two-way communication between the range slider and the resulting answer.

It was built to be placed in an iframe, so that it can be embedded into third-party websites. Because of this requirement it is fully responsive and so can be embedded at any resolution.

## My role

I was responsible for building the web app.
