Hello!

I am a freelance web developer and teacher based in Brighton.

I like to make things, and teach people how to make things.

On this site you will find a selection of projects I have worked on in my portfolio, and some of my experiments in the labs section.

If you have any comments / compliments / complaints about anything you see on this site please feel free to get in touch.
