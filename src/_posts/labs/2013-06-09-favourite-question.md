## Overview

A website (and associated social networking thing) that on a daily basis posts a new question on twitter:

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" lang="en"><p>Good morning. What&#39;s your favourite cheese?</p>&mdash; Favourite Question (@FavouriteQ) <a href="https://twitter.com/FavouriteQ/status/321517856334417920">April 9, 2013</a></blockquote>
<script async src="//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

People reply directly on twitter:

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" lang="en"><p><a href="https://twitter.com/FavouriteQ">@FavouriteQ</a> the only cheese you can use to hide a horse: mascarpone</p>&mdash; Thomas Parslow (@almostobsolete) <a href="https://twitter.com/almostobsolete/status/321525819497394176">April 9, 2013</a></blockquote>
<script async src="//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

We detect and cache all replies within 24 hours (until the next question goes out), and show daily lists of replies.

The site also has an archive section where people can look through old questions, and their answers.

People can suggest new questions at any time.
