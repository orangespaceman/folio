## Overview

A simple JavaScript file that lets you generate an image of stars or vertical lines.

It has configurable options to control the image dimensions along with the number of stars or lines that should appear.

The generated images have a transparent background so can be used in combination, for example to create parallax backgrounds.

Note that the images used on this page have had background colour added manually in order to display their content.
