## Overview

A basic multi-user drawing canvas/node/websockets thing to test realtime use of websockets across multiple devices at the same time.

There are two aspects to this lab, the drawing tool and the canvas.

Multiple users can access the controller at the same time, meaning they can collaborate on the canvas in real time.

Thanks to various libraries, it took a surprisingly small amount of code to make this.
