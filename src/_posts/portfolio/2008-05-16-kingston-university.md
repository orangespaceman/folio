## Overview

A redesign of the Kingston University site, aimed to raise the profile of the university in time for the next academic year.

## Technical solution

Along with clean valid HTML and well-structured CSS, the site features JavaScript enhancements including slideshows on section home pages, and scrolling tabs in the navigation.

These pieces of JavaScript were implemented using a methodology called progressive enhancement, so any users visiting the site through older browsers that don't offer support these features don't lose out, they see replacement content.

## My role

I was the sole developer on the build of the website.

I also provided support during the development phase, helping the in-house team at Kingston University with suggestions for how to manage the site internally. I also provided comprehensive handover documentation.
