## Overview

A web app built with the _Centre for Creativity enabled by AI (CebAI)_ from City, University of London.

The app uses AI to create suggestions to help inspire service, product and UX/UI designers to solve their challenges.


## Technical solution

The front-end of the web app is built with Vue, with Vuex for state management.

It also uses Tailwind and TypeScript.

Builds are automatically deployed to Netlify.


## My role

I helped to create the front-end of the application.
